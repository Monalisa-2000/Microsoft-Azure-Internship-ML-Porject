# BREAST-CANCER-PREDICTION MACHINE LEARNING

The Breast Cancer Prediction Machine Learning project is a tool for predicting whether a breast cancer tumor is benign or malignant using different Machine Learning algorithms. Built on the Jupyter Notebook platform and deployed in Azure, this project uses various algorithms to analyze breast cancer data and predict the outcome of a new case.

## FEATURE
Some of the key features of the Breast Cancer Prediction Machine Learning project include:

Analysis of breast cancer data to identify trends and patterns
Implementation of various Machine Learning algorithms to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant
Evaluation of algorithm performance to determine the most accurate model
Comparison of different approaches to Machine Learning for breast cancer prediction
Deployment of the model in Azure for easy accessibility
Jupyter Notebook documentation to guide the project implementation and usage

## GETTING STARTED
To use the Breast Cancer Prediction Machine Learning project, simply download or clone the repository and open the Jupyter Notebook. The notebook provides step-by-step guidance on how to run the code and use the project. Additionally, a sample dataset is provided to test the accuracy of the algorithms and make predictions. The model can also be accessed through the Azure web app.
